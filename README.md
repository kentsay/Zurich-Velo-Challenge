# Zurich-Velo-Challenge

Project for ETHZ 103-0778-00L GIS and Geoinformatics Lab[2015]. We aim to build a mobile app which use Zurich geoinformation open data and make a contribution to the Zurich Open Data community.

### Features
The app provides bike routes with different levels and types which can be chose by user preference.

* Types: city tour, mountain biking, lakeside, etc
* Info: length, elevation, special spots nearby

The app shows detail information of the selected route such as distance and duration. Users can use the routing service to start their velo journey. Besides this, the app also provides real time nearby velo rental station informations such as location, status, etc. 

### Data set
Data set we are planning to use in this app as shown as follow:
* Velowegnetz
* Routing-Service Velowege
* Veloverleih-Standorte in der Stadt Zürich
* Verfügbarkeit der Velos von «Züri rollt»
* Recommended Bike Routes in Zurich(Veloland, Bikemap.net)

Part of the data is provided by [Zurich Open Data](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/).

### Mockup
We created a mockup of our app by using [popapp](popapp.in). You can found it [here](https://popapp.in/w/projects/560d4312afde789108c11025/mockups).
